Although the theme sets the general tone of the conference, it doesn't
preclude session topics that might be considered "off theme." The goal
of the theme is to stimulate ideas, not to prevent discussion.

- MCP
- As an assistant: how can it help, where does it get in the way?
- What can we build with it right now?
- What kinds of AI can we create now, and what kind do we need to create?
- Where might it go?
  - AI Management (can we make management invisible?)
  - What will your personal AI do?
  - AI in new and surprising places (therapy, decision-making, government)
  - How will our culture change?
