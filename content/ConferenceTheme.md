Although the theme sets the general tone of the conference, it doesn't
preclude session topics that might be considered "off theme." The goal
of the theme is to stimulate ideas, not to prevent discussion.

Software Reliability
--------------------

We've made dramatic advances in many areas of software development, but reliability
seems like it's the last to gain focus---probably because the topic is so challenging.

- What are the different aspects of reliability?
- What have we tried that hasn't worked?
- What needs to change before we start taking it seriously?
- Are reliability and security connected?
- How can type systems relate to reliability?
- What architectures support reliability?
- What are new ways to think about this problem (Such as Erlang/Elixir and Scala3/ZIO2)?
