Crested Butte is a small resort town located at about 9000 feet, near the
continental divide. It is known for its scenic beauty, skiing in the winter and
hiking, mountain biking, and other outdoor activities in the summer.<br/><br/>

We hold the event [in town](/venue), and free buses run up to the ski mountain
every 15 minutes.

[This site](http://www.downtowncrestedbutte.com/) is probably the most
well-maintained reference to hotels and restaurants in downtown Crested Butte
(where we hold the event -- note that you should try to stay downtown and not on
the mountain, so you can just walk everywhere). This site only lists hotel-style
lodging; there are numerous AirB&B's and VRBO-style spaces available.

High-speed Internet is available in the conference location and at
several locations within easy walking distance of the conference
location. Many lodgings provide Internet access but you should ask to
make sure.

**Restaurants:**
[This](http://www.downtowncrestedbutte.com/restaurants-in-crested-butte/)
is a reasonably accurate list. There are also a few restaurants on the
mountain.

**Often people stay the day after the conference or for the weekend;
informal gatherings have been known to happen.**

lodging and the Crested Butte experience.
