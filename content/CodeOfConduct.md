title: Code of Conduct
weight: 25
---

This conference is about discussion, inclusion and connection, and we want
everyone to feel as comfortable as possible. Although we cannot guarantee you
will have a good time, we can certainly do our best to make sure you don't have
a *bad* time, and the baseline for this is that no one should ever be harassed.

To achieve this goal, all participants, sponsors and volunteers at our event
are required to agree with this Code of Conduct (CoC). Organizers will enforce
this CoC throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to
help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

This CoC applies during the entire duration of the conference (not just during
formal sessions or conference-specific locations).

***We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Harassment
includes offensive verbal comments related to disability, gender, gender
identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, physical appearance, body
size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public
spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
contact, or unwelcome attention of any kind.***

Participants violating these rules are expected to immediately cease the
offending behavior upon notification. Participants who continue to violate these
rules after being notified may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without
a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Points of Contact
-----------------

We recognize that managing harassment at the Winter Tech Forum is not the job of
its recipients. The conference organizer and delegated individuals (*contact
persons*) will make themselves available to address any & all complaints of
harassment, and the relevant contact information for them will be made available
to participants on arrival at the conference, during the initial meeting.

What You Can Expect
-------------------

If there is a problem and you reach out to one of the contact persons, you
can expect that:

1. You will be heard and trusted.

2. The conference organizer will be informed.

3. A discussion will be initiated between the contact person and/or conference
   organizer and the person in question, to stop the behavior in question
   and possibly include a warning to that person.

If you're not sure that behavior counts as harassment, please reach out to any
contact person. We are happy to talk it over with you.

Our Goal for this CoC
---------------------

There are usually laws and rules and social norms about these issues. But those
don't seem to be enough, as we've seen in many conferences. There are unspoken
practices that are considered acceptable within subgroups, but never written
down, and these produce behaviors that are considered acceptable as a result.
Because no one says anything or puts a stake in the ground about these
behaviors, it seems OK to those practicing them. Saying nothing doesn't work.

We don't, however, want people to be terrified that they might accidentally say
something wrong, and that if they do make such a faux pas they will immediately
be forcibly ejected. Simply punishing mistakes without giving someone the
opportunity to learn is not the goal of this CoC.

The CoC tells you when you've made a mistake, and empowers others to have a
conversation with you about it. And most importantly, it tells newcomers &
traditionally marginalized attendees that we value their safety. The focus is on
the goal that "you will not be harassed."

There are times when it doesn't matter what you do, someone might be having a
bad day and feel anger or some other emotion regardless of who is nearby or
what they do. The CoC shouldn't be a weapon in that situation, on either end.
The CoC draws the line on harassment &mdash; it says what you cannot do (harass)
but it doesn't say what you must do (speak a certain way).

If You are Having a Hard Time Communicating
-------------------------------------------

These [Principles of Nonviolent Communication](https://www.cnvc.org/Training/NVC-Concepts)
might be helpful:

1. Differentiate observation from evaluation.

    - Carefully observe what is happening, free of evaluation.

    - Specify behaviors and conditions that affect you.

2. Differentiate feeling from thinking.

    - Identify and express internal feeling states in a way that does not
      imply judgment, criticism, blame or punishment.

3. Frame your experience within universal human needs that are
    being met or not met in relation to what is happening and how you are feeling.

    - Examples: connection, sustenance, trust, and understanding.

4. Make a Request.

    - Clearly and specifically state what you *do* want, not what you don’t
      want.

    - Make a request and not a demand. If it's truly a request, there is no
      consequence for saying "no."

    - Before making the request, check your feelings to ensure you are not
      attempting to motivate, however subtly, through fear, guilt, shame, or
      obligation.

    - A genuine request allows the other person to give you a gift.

The Four Agreements, By Don Miguel Ruiz
---------------------------------------

1. **Be Impeccable with your Word:** Speak with integrity. Say only what you
   mean. Avoid using the Word to speak against yourself or to gossip about
   others. Use the power of your Word in the direction of truth and love.

2. **Don’t Take Anything Personally:** Nothing others do is because of you. What
   others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When
   you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim
   of needless suffering.

3. **Don’t Make Assumptions:** Find the courage to ask questions and to express
   what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid
   misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can
   completely transform your life.

4. **Always Do Your Best:** Your best changes from moment to moment; it is
   different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance,
   simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and
   regret.
