Organized by Bruce Eckel<br/>
<span style="font-size:150%">August 15-19, 2022</span>
<span style="font-size:75%"><br/>(Formerly The Java Posse Roundup)</span>

- **NOTE**: Many companies are still not supporting travel to conferences, so
  the event this Summer has become a *developer retreat*, which is a smaller and
  far less formal gathering. It does not have an entrance fee, because we will
  not be using the Parish Hall as we usually do. In addition, we will not be
  following the schedule on this site, but will organically be creating
  discussions, workshops to explore particular topics, and outdoor activities.

- Attendance limited to 45

- Please be fully vaccinated before attending.

- When scheduling, remember [there are events](/schedule) the afternoon of the
  14th and the morning of the 20th.

<!--
- If you've previously attended a Crested Butte event and need a break on the
  fee, <a href="/contact">make a request</a>. Don't let the fee be the reason
  you can't attend.

- *I wanted to let you know how much I thoroughly enjoyed the week I spent in Crested Butte for the WTF conference. Thanks for helping to organize such a wonderful conference and bringing together such a great group of people. It was exciting to see how a group left unto themselves, can self organize and set out on a meaningful course. This spirit of the event really resonated with me and I'm looking forward to continuing this journey thoughout the year.* -- Will Mooney

- *The WTF took me to places I never imagined I would go; intellectually, emotionally, career-wise, and geographically. The power of this tiny thing is immeasurable.* -- Andrew Harmel-Law, Tech Principal at ThoughtWorks

- *I'm still stunned by how impactful WTF is ... each year I walk away with a sense of knowing what I need to focus on that will help make an impact on my team and our projects.* -- Matt Brandt, Mozilla

- *The roundup has been the best and most transformative conference of my life, by far. It's directly responsible for getting me where I am.* -- Joe Sondow

- *In my experience, the open-spaces forums that Bruce has facilitated have been a great source of new ideas, new friends in the tech world, and a fresh source of inspiration and energy I could apply to my regular work.* -- Joel Neely
